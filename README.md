## TODO-List
- Vehicle Speed

- Baritone Sprint Jump
- Fix Trajectories
- BowAimbot
- More Anti Bots
- Inventory management
- KillAura: Simulate Damage in case cooldown isn't gone but full dmg isn't needed to kill somebody
- PvP-Bot for Practice Game Modes
- Fix PlayerUtil#simulateAttack
- Clear buffers on world change in Blink/Latency
- Stop using Thread.stop
- KillAura: Don't turn inside enemies
- Configure ESP
- Don't hide disabled settings, grey them out (looks sick prob)
- Don't be able to friend localplayer/self
- Make the friend alias feature accessable to the user (frontend is missing)
- MidClick (alias prompt with screen and callback?)
- KillAura: Calculate attack cycle from enemies
- NoSlowdown seperate allowed actions and bypassed actions

## Notes
- Matrix Bots never sneak (might be applicable to other bots)
- AutoTool: Axes can set shields on cooldown. Maybe implement that if possible axes are being used to set shields on cooldown before actually attacking with sword
